4. On the "My Stamps" page, you will need to complete some verification steps.  You will see a grid of options you can choose from to raise your Web3 passport score. Your score is shown at the top of the page, starting out at 0. You will need a passport score of at least 5 points. This means you will need to select multiple verification methods to raise your score above 5. In my case, I verified using Google, Discord, and Twitter. Other easy options include Twitter and Coinbase as part of verification process. Once you reach the passport score of 5, you may move on to the next step.

After you press confirm, you will need to verify your E-mail address. Open your E-mail and click the link sent to you. Lastly, click confirm once link is loaded.

Congrats! You now have a DTube Avalon account and are set up to be able to receive DTC tokens. 


### Optional Instructions
 Since you were given a master key to your account, it is safer to create a custom key with limited permissions. For example you could use an alternative key that only gives you the permission to make comments and upvote, and denying permissions such as sending DTC token to another address. To get started with a custom key, follow the instructions below:
1. Login to DTube using your username and master key and then on the left side of the page press "My Channel", and then the "Keys" tab.
2. Press the "New Custom Key" Pulldown,

3. Tick the permissions that you want and then press "Create" at the bottom.
